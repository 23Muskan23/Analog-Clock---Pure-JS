# Analog-Clock---Pure-JS
# Analog Clock - Pure JavaScript

## Description
This project is a simple and elegant analog clock built using **HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript**. The clock updates in real-time and features smooth animations for the clock hands.

## Features
- Built with **vanilla JavaScript** (no external libraries)
- Real-time updates using `setInterval()`
- Smooth CSS transitions for clock hands
- Fully responsive design

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Analog-Clock-Pure-JS.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Analog-Clock-Pure-JS
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage
- The clock will display the current time based on your system clock.
- It updates every second to ensure real-time accuracy.
